# SideSheet

A sheet is a large container that is triggered by the user and enters from the edge of the screen. It's used to provide additional actions and information that's related to the page.

## Props

<Props of={SideSheet} />

## Usage

```jsx
import { SideSheet } from '@/dfds-ui/react-components/src'
```

Used on desktop only, nested side sheets exist alongside the primary UI and the user can interact with both surfaces simoultaneously.

export const padding = {
  padding: '15px',
}
export const margin = {
  margin: '15px',
}

export const Navigation = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <NavBar href="/">
      <NavBarItem href="#">DFDS Platform</NavBarItem>
      <NavBarItem href="#">Rest of DFDS</NavBarItem>
