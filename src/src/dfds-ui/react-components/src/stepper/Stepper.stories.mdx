Types of Steppers: Horizontal, Vertical, Sequential, None-Sequential

```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Stepper} />

## Types of Steppers

### Horizontal stepper

The step name and numbers on horizontal bar, which can be fixed to the top page when scrolling down.
Step names should be as short as possible to save space.

### Vertical stepper

The vertical stepper works the same way as a horizontal stepper, only it cant take child components wrapped in `<StepContent/>` components.

### Sequential stepper

Sequential steppers require users to complete one step in order to move on to the next step.

It's still possible to ad optional steps to a sequential stepper. By passing passing the prop `optionalLabel:string` the step will be marked as optional, as seen below.

### None-sequential stepper

When a stepper is not sequential a user can navigate the steps freely or enter at any point the flow.

The user can also navigate by clicking directly at step button.

### Stepper with feedback messages

A feedback message can be passed to display a transitory feedback message as the step label.

Stepper feedback should only be used if there is a long latency between steps.

#### Horizontal Stepper with feedback messages

In a horizontal stepper, the feedback message will be displayed replacing all steps.

#### Vertical Stepper with feedback messages

In a vertical stepper, the feedback message will be displayed replacing the active step label and button.

### Step states

Steps can have different states. Each step state can be controlled by passing the appropriate prop, as shown below.
