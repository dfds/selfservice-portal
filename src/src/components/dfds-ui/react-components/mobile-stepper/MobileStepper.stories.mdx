# Mobile stepper

Mobile steppers are designed for small screens and is ideal for mobiles. It has less features compared to `Stepper`.
`MobileStepper` will not assist in controlling steps for sequential flow whereas `Stepper` does. `MobileStepper` only displays progress with the ability to go back and fo forth.

`MobileStepper` has two variants to display progress through the available steps: text and dots.
