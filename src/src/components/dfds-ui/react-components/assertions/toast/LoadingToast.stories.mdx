# Section reload

Uses the `Toast` component, ideal to use when the user triggers a refresh of data in nested component within the main UI.
E.g when refreshing results in a data table. It should only appear if there is a delay of longer than 0.5 seconds and should disappear once the loading is complete.

## Usage

Import the component:

```jsx
import { Toast } from '@/components/dfds-ui/react-components'
```

Use the component:

## Loading

<Preview>
  <Story name="Section reload">
    <Toast loading intent="info">
      Loading results...
    </Toast>
  </Story>
</Preview>
